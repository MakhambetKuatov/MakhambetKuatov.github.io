      <p>Ants, together with bees and wasps, belong to the family of the Formicidae. Ants’ bodies are divided into three pieces: head, thorax, and abdomen. They have six legs and two antennas.

The Dinoponera is the largest ant in the world, it measures a good 3cm to 4cm long and the Carebara atoma is believed to be the smallest in the world measuring a millimeter long.</p>

    <h1>Cats</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>About them</h2>
      <p>Cat is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.</p>
    <h2>Basic info</h2>
      <p>The popularity of the cat, especially of pedigreed breeds, has continued to grow. The cat’s independent personality, grace, cleanliness, and subtle displays of affection have wide appeal. Typically, cats are creatures of habit; they are inquisitive, but not adventurous, and are easily upset by sudden changes of routine. The ideal household cat has been separated from its mother between the ages of two and four months, raised in a clean home, kept away from unhealthy animals, and inoculated against common infectious cat diseases. Although cats often enjoy the company of other cats, especially when raised together from kittenhood, introducing a strange cat to other cats in the home can cause stress, aggression, and other behaviour problems. Cats are generally less sociable than dogs, who more readily accept a new pack member.</p>
    <h2>Advantages</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No need to walk out</li>
        <li>Not necessary to leave alone</li>

        <li>Need constantly sharpening claws</li>
